# UCSB_Stats
Goals of project:

1. Scrape 2021-2022 statistics from ESPN for UCSB's basketball team.  

2. Compile those statistics and calculate per-minute versions of those statistics.  

3. So that this data will automatically update with each game played, create a streamlit app that displays a sortable dataframe with the up to date per-minute statistics.
